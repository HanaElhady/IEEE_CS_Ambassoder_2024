# Problem 3

# Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and calculates its factorial.

# EX:

# Input: 5

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).


num = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
fact = 1;
for i in range(2 , num + 1) :
    fact*=i;
print(f"factorial of {num} is {fact}")
