# Problem 4

# -Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to that integer.

# EX:

# Input: 6

# Output: The sum of even numbers from 1 to 6 is 12 (2 + 4 + 6).

num = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
sum = 0;
for i in range(2 , num+2 , 2) :
    sum+= i
print(f"The sum of even numbers from 1 to {num} is {sum}")
