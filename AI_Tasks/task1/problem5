# Problem 5

# -Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and finds its prime factors.

# EX:

# Input: 36

# Output: Prime Factors: 2, 3

import math

n = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
print(f"Prime factors of {n} are:")

for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 1):
    c =0 ;
    while n % i == 0:
        if c == 0:
            print(i)
        c+=1
        n /= i

if n != 1:
    print(n)
