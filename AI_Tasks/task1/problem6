# Problem 6

# -Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and checks whether it is a perfect number or not.
#A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.

# EX:

# Input: 28

# Output: 28 is a perfect number.

num = int(input("Write a positive integer : "))
sum = 1
for i in range(2 , num , 1) :
     if num%i == 0 :
        sum+=i
if sum == num :
    print(f"{num} is a perfect number.")
else :
    print(f"{num} is not a perfect number.")
