# Problem 8

# Write a Python program that continuously takes numbers as input from the user and adds them to a list until the user enters 'done'. Then, it calculates and prints the average of the numbers.

# EX:

# Input: 5, 10, 15, done

# Output: "The average is 10."

num =input("Write a num , write 'done' to exit the program : " )
num_list = []
      
sum = 0
c = 0

while num != 'done' :
    c +=1
    num_list.append(int(num))
    sum = int(num)+ sum
    num =input("Write a num , write 'done' to exit the program : " )
    
if c!=0 :    
    average = sum//c
else :
    average = 0
print(f"The average is {average}.")
